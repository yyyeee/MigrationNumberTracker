MigrationNumberTracker (Relevant for Scalepoint employees only)
======================
- Migration number reservation tray client + REST sever
- Server part deployed deployed to ecx-build so VPN is needed
- Use Win+R shell:startup to launch at startup
- left-click - quick menu to reserve client/host and copy prefix Мххх_ to clipboard
- right-click - to reserve non-standard migrations
- undo - helps, if wrong migration type was misclicked (will undo your last migration number reservation _if_ no migration numbers were reserved afterwards, last migration number reserved stored beetween tool launches)
- Manage manually - use this to manually fix the data
